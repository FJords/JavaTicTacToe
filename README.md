The Tic Tac Toe game implemented here is a Java-based graphical application designed to provide a classic, engaging, and interactive gaming experience. Built using Swing, the application features a user-friendly interface that allows two players to take turns in marking their respective symbols ("X" and "O") on a 3x3 grid. 

The game adheres to the traditional rules of Tic Tac Toe, where the objective is to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the match.

The code is structured to ensure smooth gameplay with real-time feedback, making it easy for players to follow along and stay engaged.

Key features such as automatic win detection, tie recognition, and intuitive visual cues enhance the overall user experience. Additionally, the application is designed with accessibility and usability in mind, employing high-contrast colors and large fonts to cater to a wide range of users.
